# Agent Coding Policy

**Before taking any coding action (including creating, editing, or deleting files):**

1. **Plan your approach carefully.**
   - Explain your plan to the user in detail using clear steps or reasoning.
2. **Ask for explicit permission.**
   - Always request user approval before proceeding with any coding, file creation, or file deletion.
3. **Do not make any changes until the user approves your plan.**

> ⚠️ *Strictly follow these steps to ensure transparency and user control over all coding actions.*
